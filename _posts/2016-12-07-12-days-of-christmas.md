Christmas is my ultimate favorite holiday and I do not take it lightly. It‚Äôs the one time a year where I don‚Äôt have to worry about school, get to spend time with my
family, listen to Mariah Carey on repeat, and watch amazing movies! There are so many to choose from that it was incredibly hard to compile my top 12 favorite. This will
be a sort of Movie Advent Calendar that I will be following and hopefully you will too üôÇ (The list ranges from older to newer movies, and has a range of sub-genres that
hopefully will entertain even the most Scrooge-y of you).

On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me‚Ä¶

<h3>#1 Die Hard (1988)</h3>

<img class="img-center" src="/images/6-die-hard.jpg"/>

The one and only action movie on this list. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, this is the perfect time, especially if you‚Äôre not into the warm/fuzzy feeling of Christmas. Bruce
Willis fighting some bad guys while Jingle Bells plays in the background. Epic.

<h3>#2 It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life (1946)</h3>

<img class="img-center" src="/images/6-wonderful-life.gif"/>

I have watched this movie most years for Christmas and every time I see it, I enjoy it more and more. Maybe it‚Äôs because every year I understand George‚Äôs struggles a
little bit better. This is a wonderful (get it?) story about life and love and the magic of giving yourself a second chance.

<h3>#3 Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)</h3>

<img class="img-center" src="/images/6-muppet.gif"/>

To be fair, you could watch any version of the Christmas Carol and that would be okaaaay‚Ä¶.but with an amazing soundtrack, the Muppet‚Äôs version trumps all the others, even
the Disney version, which pains me. (I‚Äôll probably be watching both to be honest).

<h3>#4 Love Actually (2003)</h3>

<img class="img-center" src="/images/6-love-actually.gif"/>

I only watched this holiday classic last Christmas and it has definitely made it to the list again this year. With its wide variety of actors and plots, this quick-witted
British drama made its way to people‚Äôs hearts. There are ups and downs with warmhearted life lessons and holiday cheer that makes this film quite memorable.

<h3>#5 Arthur Christmas (2011)</h3>

<img class="img-center" src="/images/6-arthur.gif"/>

I love love love this movie. As a very curious child, I always wondered how Santa could possibly deliver all those presents in such a short period of time. With
ultra-high technology and incredibly creative ideas, this film finally gives a clear explanation. Although it is an animated movie, I really think anyone can enjoy it.

<h3>#6 Miracle on 34th Street (1994)</h3>

<img class="img-center" src="/images/6-miracle-34th.gif"/>

This is probably the best Christmas movie on Netflix right now. There‚Äôs also an older version which is just as good but black and white. The whole time, you don‚Äôt really
know what to believe, whether Santa Clause exists or not. But regardless, it‚Äôs not about the actual existence of a man in a red suit or about the technicalities of how he
delivers the presents or lives in the North Pole. It‚Äôs the symbol he represents. In it, Santa says, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt believe, if you can‚Äôt accept anything on faith, then
you‚Äôre doomed for a life dominated by doubt.‚Äù That‚Äôs one of the most powerful quotes I‚Äôve ever heard.

<h3>#7 A Christmas Story (1983)</h3>

<img class="img-center" src="/images/6-christmas-story.gif"/>

This is a classic. Funny, witty, and ultimately warms your heart with Christmas spirit. This film is timeless so if you‚Äôre not that into 80‚Äôs movies, I‚Äôd still give this
one a chance.

<h3>#8 Elf (2003)</h3>

<img class="img-center" src="/images/6-elf.gif"/>

Will Farrel plays Buddy the Elf, who is a human kid adopted by elves that grows up in the North Pole thinking he is, in fact, and elf. However, when the truth comes out,
he sets on a journey to New York City to find his father and spread his Christmas Cheer. A little secret about me, I am not the biggest Will Farrel fan. However, he kills
it in this movie and really sets the Christmas mood.

<h3>#9 National Lampoon‚Äôs Christmas Vacation (1989)</h3>

<img class="img-center" src="/images/6-national-lampoon.gif"/>

Another amazing comedy and a classic within my family, this movie is a satire of Christmas family reunions and traditions. It makes fun of every aspect of a Christmas
holiday, from Christmas shopping to funny relatives and silly expectations. Overall, it might be the funniest of the National Lampoon‚Äôs movies and definitely my favorite.

<h3>#10 The Polar Express (2004)</h3>

<img class="img-center" src="/images/6-polar-express.gif"/>

For those who no longer believe in Santa (or the overall magic of Christmas), this movie will bring some of that innocence back. It is fun, uniquely animated, and
gorgeously produced. I love the sensitive plot and the ending simply makes my eyes water every time.

<h3>#11 The Grinch</h3>

<img class="img-center" src="/images/6-the-grinch.gif"/>

I have watched this movie every year without miss. It is hilarious, heartwarming, and Jim Carey gives an unforgettable performance as the Dr. Seuss‚Äô The Grinch. Not to
mention a lot of us can relate to the character, especially during finals week.  The soundtrack is amazing and the overall message is sweet. Fun Fact: Cindy Lou Who is
played by a young Taylor Momsen who plays troubled girl Jenny Humphrey in CW‚Äôs Gossip Girl and later became the lead singer of rock band The Pretty Reckless‚Ä¶Which is
pretty crazy.

<h3>#12 Mickey‚Äôs Once Upon a Christmas Story (1999)</h3>

</div>

This is probably really random, and most of you haven‚Äôt seen this film, most likely. It‚Äôs a compilation of three short Disney stories following the classic characters of
Goofy, Donald, and Mickey. Each story is amazing in its own way and teaches a very important lesson about what Christmas is all about. It‚Äôs the last story, however, that
I love the most. It shows the importance of sacrifice when it comes to the ones we love. It‚Äôs a pretty short movie, so give it a watch, promise you won‚Äôt regret it.

Hope you enjoy these, I definitely will üôÇ

Merry Christmas everyone!
