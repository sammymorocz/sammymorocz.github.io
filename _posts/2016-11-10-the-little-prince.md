Everyone’s dream is to see the perfect film adaptation to their all-time favorite book. Or, at least that’s my dream. I remember watching the trailer for the animated
adaptation of The Little Prince last year and being very nervous for it. It had so many expectations to fulfill, such an incredible story to tell.

I always cut some slack to movie adaptations of books because there are certain stories that are meant to be told in several hundred pages of carefully written chapters
in a novel, and stories that are more easily told through the big screen. It is very rare to be able to capture the same story in both mediums perfectly.

However, the animated adaptation of The Little Prince was so well done that it deserves the great Sammy seal of approval:

There are three key elements that made this, to me, a very successful adaptation: Imagery, Lessons, and Originality.

The Little Prince, written by French author, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, is a novella written for children as well as adults that follows the story of a little boy from
space who meets a pilot in the desert and describes the world of adults from the point of view of a child. Through poetic descriptions and illustrations, the book creates
a vivid fantasy world that depicts some of the most essential themes of life and humanity. Everything about the book is absolutely beautiful and if you haven’t had a
chance to read it, I highly recommend it. However, translating that same feeling

to film is certainly not an easy task. I loved how MarkOsborne, the director of the film, stayed true to the book by separating the story into two: one for the actual
scenery of the book narration and another for an outside story that was used as a translator to show how the book (written in 1943) is still very relevant today. He used
two different types of animation to make the distinction between stories. This was done just as beautifully and uniquely as the book. Every scene in the film is its own
work of art and some of the most important illustrations in the book were directly animated into the film. I absolutely loved the animation and scenery.

But more important than how it looked is whether the movie was able to portray some of the key elements and lessons from the book. One of my favorite quotes from the book
says, “It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.” This powerful quote was directed translated into the film. But not
only that, it was also implemented very carefully in the outside story that follows a little girl’s journey to finding what’s truly

important to her. Another big theme is the dangers of narrow-mindness, a topic that is very much still relevant today. The film is able to captivate the audience by
creating a setting we can all relate to: Having to go to school, getting good grades in order to get into a good university in order to get a good job in order to
be…”happy”? But The Little Prince breaks that status quo. It challenges the reader to think about how big the world is, the possibilities of our universe, and even the
endless potential that lies inside us. To me, the film did a very good job of translating that for all audiences: adults and children. Some extra brownie points for the
film was the fact that they included all of my favorite characters (which helped stay true to the original story) like the rose, the pilot, the vain man, the snake…and
most importantly the fox.

I’m quite sure that if they had kept their story line to follow the book word by word it would have still been a success. But the way the director and script-writers were
able to directly show how a book written decades ago is still very relevant today takes this movie to another level of originality. Every moment in the movie moves you
somehow, pulling strings in my heart I forgot I had. The relationship between the little girl and her mother and how different it was from her father, the pilot’s light
charisma in a very dull world, the love of the little prince for his rose and the fox….This movie took an already incredible story and made it even greater. Every
character was incredibly dimensional and human. Although animated, I truly recommend this movie for anyone who is looking to reflect on some of the most important lessons
in life, or even anyone that wants some food for thought.

I could rant about this movie forever. If you have a chance to watch it (or if you’ve read the book), let me know what you think!
