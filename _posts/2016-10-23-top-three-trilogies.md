3 has always been my favorite number. Everything good comes in 3’s. It creates a perfect balance where no 1 part of the 3 can be without the other two. Growing up with
two siblings really showed me how important is to have balance. Not to mention that the number 3 has always brought me luck, at least that’s what I like to think.

In film, when done right, trilogies are a blessing for movie fans because it just allows us to have more of what we already loved with the first or second movie. It
brings balance to the plot and gives the screenwriters enough time to create three significant small plots that melt into one complete plot-king. And that’s just magical.

These are my top 3 favorite trilogies:

<h3>Back to the Future (1985, 1989, 1990)</h3>
Great Scott! This glorious trilogy directed by Robert Zemeckis not only gave us one of the best time-traveling science fiction plots of all times, but it also introduced
some of the most timeless characters, one-liners, and film icons. These films are strongly characterized by their quick-witted dialogue, comedy, and ultimate 80’s vibe.
Although all three were released way before I was born, I am grateful that my oldest brother made them critical for me to watch over and over again as I grew up. (Also,
if you ever happen to come across any of these films on TV, drop everything you’re doing and watch because there’s nothing better than to stumble upon a Back to the
Future marathon on TV, especially on a Sunday).

Some trilogies are released mostly because the first couple of movies were successful and it’s a guarantee that the third will be successful as well. Trilogies should
happen, however, because the story is just not complete without the three movies. And Back to the Future is a great example of that. In a timeline that is a bit crazy,
going back and forth between three decades, all three movies are interconnected. There are events that happen in the third movie that explain things that happen in the
first and second. The three films really do come as a whole, and watching just one doesn’t give the story the credit and attention it deserves. That’s a great trilogy.
Plus it has a flying DeLorean, cowboys, 50’s references, and a future that is a bit more interesting than ours. What else could you ask for?

<h3>Lord of the Rings (2001, 2002, 2003)</h3>
Lord of the Rings was one trilogy that took me some time to like. I was very young when they came out and just really wasn’t into fantasy plots at all. However, this all
changed the day my older brother (a different one) decided to have a Lord of the Rings marathon. These movies are long with complicated plots but nevertheless absolutely
fantastic. Peter Jackson was able to portray J.R.R Tolkien’s fantasy world to the detail and the cast, visual effects, and score were all flawless. Frodo’s journey to
defeat evil by destroying ‘the ring’ is compelling and unique. Gollum is a character that is widely known even by those who have never watched Lord of the Rings which is
pretty amazing.

One thing that makes this great trilogy is that Frodo’s journey is not over until the third film. There is no way that after watching the first someone could be like “oh,
well, I can imagine what happens, that’s it.” No. Once you start, you have to finish. And that’s something very unique about this series. It became world-wide famous and
there’s even people that speak the language of Elves fluently. The community is strong and loyal, which was proved at the release of The Hobbit trilogy. Not only has this
trilogy won 17 Academy Awards including Best Picture, but it has been nominated for 30, and, frankly, the references will forever be part of our pop-culture.

<h3>Toy Story (1995, 1999, 2010)</h3>
The winner for most spaced out movies in a trilogy definitely goes to Toy Story. I have grown up with these films and although each one could stand on its own, the story
is not really complete until you watch them all. With the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, Woody and Buzz Lightyear bring back my fondest childhood memories and the
greatest nostalgia every time. With a great soundtrack and attention to detail, every single one of these films commemorate the innocence of children and the value of
friendship.

Although Pixar is said to release the fourth film in 2018, we can appreciate this story as one of the best trilogies of all time for now. What is very special about Toy
Story, mostly in the third film, is that its release was timed perfectly so that kids that had seen the first two growing up, would be well on their way to college just
the way Andy was in the movie. Manipulating emotions is not something new to Pixar, but they definitely take the gold with Toy Story 3. That movie made every single
member in my family cry. Actual tears. (Probably because my brother was leaving to college as well).  And it was also able to tie the loop back around and create a
perfect plot between the three films where every viewer was satisfied with the ending.
