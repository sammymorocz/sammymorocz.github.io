Aloha! Welcome back to my blog, a place I use to express my opinions and other fun facts about movies and TV shows. It's been a while but I wanted to make sure to dip my toes back into the ocean of films! (This joke will make more sense in a second.)

I want to talk about my favorite Disney character and the reasons why I relate to this funny little girl. If you have never seen Lilo & Stitch, an animated Disney original about a fugitive alien that lands in Hawaii and befriends a girl named Lilo, you are missing out on what could possibly be Disney’s most original and complete story. There are many, many reasons to why this movie is incredibly precious: It’s hilarious (especially if you watch it with me). Every character is unique, funny, and smart. The character of Stitch is unforgettable and has become an icon for the Disney franchise, especially in merchandise. But, personally, whenever I watch the movie, it is Lilo that I am most intrigued by. She is very quirky, is shown to be lonely, has an amazing heart, and is funny as heck. Lilo has a special place in my heart, and I want to tell you why. Let’s get started! (Also, I realized the joke still didn’t make much sense but oh well…)

<h3>#1 Lilo says what she means and means what she says </h3>

Although she tries really hard to feel a sense of belonging after her parents pass away, Lilo is a free soul. She loves nature and every one of her hobbies. Although she is young, she shows love for a lot of different things, including Elvis Presley, photography, dancing, and nature. She is not afraid to be herself and even when she is not accepted by the other girls, she finds comfort in herself and doesn’t let them bring her down. She knows she is different, and although she finds it difficult sometimes, most of the time she embraces it and has so much fun with it. When picking Stitch out from the shelter, she knew he was special no matter how weird and different he was. She is very assertive in what she wants and always stands up for what she believes in.

<h3>#2 Lilo is freaking hilarious </h3>

This movie is funny. And Lilo? She’s hilarious. Most of the time, she’s not even trying to be funny. It’s just part of her nature. The things she says and does are all adorable and silly. She does things like make sandwiches for her pet fish that she visits every Thursday. Her active imagination keeps her entertained and shows us so much about her personality.

<h3>#3 Ohana </h3>

Family is what matters the most to Lilo, especially now that her family is a little broken. As soon as she adopts Stitch, he becomes part of her family and she does everything she can to protect him even when his level of badness is very high.

She believes in her sister, Nani, and does not understand when the social service agent does not believe in her. She wants Nani to be with David (her on-and-off boyfriend) because she thinks that would make her happy. At the end of the movie, she welcomes two other aliens, Pleakly and Jumba (the designated aliens to capture Stitch and bring him back), into the family as well. Everything is about family, and I can totally relate to her. After all, “Ohana means family. And family means no one gets left behind, or forgotten.”

I know Lilo is not considered a Disney princess, but she feels like Disney royalty to me. She is the Disney character I relate to the most. She is also around 6 years old (although not confirmed), so that certainly says a lot about my personality. She is stubborn and impatient, like me. But she has a good heart. I hope if there’s ever a sequel with her grown up, we will see that she never changed in her quirkiness and that she is still the same weirdo as always. 

I love, love, love Lilo. Who is your favorite Disney character?
