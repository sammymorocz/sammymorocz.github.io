I am not sure if it was due to the elegant execution of its plot, the diversity of the characters, or the subtle references and Star Wars familiarity that made this movie
great. But Rogue One achieved something I thought impossible: Be just as good or even better than the rest of the series.

The plot is based around the story of new characters. Jyn Erso is the daughter of an engineer who is forced to build a powerful weapon for the empire. Through a series of
events, she and the rest of the main characters discover the existence of the Death Star, a planet destroyer, and that it has a weakness. Their journey takes them through
the galaxy in search of the plans and designs of this weapon in order to destroy it. As the movie ends we are thrown right into the first scene in Star Wars – A New Hope,
which began the entire franchise.

Although Rogue One has a superficially complicated plot, it’s actually rather simple, a characteristic that made the film succeed. It’s based on the Alliance, or the
rebels, versus the Empire, or the bad guys. It utilized all the strengths of a Star Wars movie, like the peculiarities of the universe and mystery of the force, for its
benefit and minimized all the weaknesses, like any plot holes or over-dramatic scenes. It’s crude, interesting, and to the point. The plot started quite large, with the
introduction of several strange characters, but the dots connected swiftly to one central climax and an excellent ending. It includes plenty of Star Wars human action
(with very little or no physical presence of the Force), light humor at the right moments, detailed character development (which I will talk more about), and a
proportional antagonist, critical to the success of a movie such as Rogue One.

What I mean by proportional antagonist, which I briefly explained in an older post, is my sort of theory that movies are better when the “bad guy” is not unrealistically
bad. Whatever the antagonist is (nature, human, or self), unless it’s meant to win for the sake of the plot, should be big enough that makes it interesting, but small
enough so that we can believe the hero won. And as much of a simple concept that is, a lot of movies fail at this, mostly because their purpose is to attract viewers
through bigger explosions, more after effects, and more violence. That is all valid, however it’s not what makes a movie good to me. Rogue One does a fantastic job at
scaling the bad guy down, who by nature is rather large (the entire Empire and Darth Vader), and making it a realistic defeat. The characters of Rogue One don’t have to
defeat the entire Dark Side or even destroy the Death Star…They only need to find a set of engineering plans and send a signal to the rebels, fighting against only one
imperial base, and a single imperial general, something a lot more realistic. The rest is done through the films that follow it.

However, being realistic doesn’t mean the film is not interesting. In fact, through the impeccable use of the characters, Rogue One has earned its spot along the rest of
the series. Jyn, played by Felicity Jones, is a strong female lead that feels very natural in the story. She has been affected very personally by the war both from the
Empire and the Alliance and doesn’t feel the necessity to help out unlike Luke Skywalker does in the next movies. Jyn decides to join the cause only when she realizes her
father is involved and that she may have a chance to be reunited with him. Although strong, she is also very human, a victim of a cruel war, and is slowly developed into
a Star Wars hero. We see what is done to her through the story as something very similarly done to Han Solo in A New Hope. Felicity Jones, although not an entirely new
face (she’s starred in big movies like Jane Erye and The Theory of Everything), still incorporates herself entirely into this story. Cassian Andor, played by Mexican
actor Diego Luna, is a very new face on the contrary, and he does a very good job as well. He is a soldier, following orders, and deciding that just because he is part of
the rebels, that doesn’t mean everything he does is good in nature. Although I found Luna’s character a bit of a cliche, he soon became an irreplaceable part of the main
group of characters, who all need each other in order to succeed. Donnie Yen and Jian Wen, both very talented Chinese actors, who play Chirrut Imwe (the blind monk) and
Baze Malbus (an assassin) created a fantastic duo. They brought the mystery of the force to life and connected us to the innocence of the Star Wars plot. The imperial
pilot, played by Riz Ahmed, was not the most important character. Although Ahmed fully committed to his role and the character does grow on you, this was one I thought
could have been given more attention to. After all, it’s the first time we see real treason from an imperial soldier (until episode VII)…why? What made him want to do
something like that? It would have been nice to find the answers to those questions. Finally, Firefly’s star Alan Tudyk was the voice of K-2So, a familiar metallic
character with an unfamiliar attitude. His sarcasm and comedic relief was funny and well executed from beginning to end. Overall, every character plays a crucial part in
the movie and it’s their camaraderie that gives parallelism to the friendship between Luke, Leia, and Han we all love.

SPOILERS:
Some final thoughts: the subtle (and not so subtle) hints to connect Rogue One to the rest of the series were so exciting. Seeing Grand Moff Tarkin, Leia, and Darth Vader
was very elegantly done and although the use of effects could still be noticed on the first two personas, it was really well done.

And…Galen Erso, played by Mads Mikkelsen who also played the villain in Casino Royale (James Bond), was the first not evil character I see this actor play. Although very
odd, it was kind of refreshing.

Those are my thoughts on Rogue One: A Star Wars Story! Please let me know yours, there’s a lot I could not cover to avoid giving away too much of the plot. Hope you enjoy
and may the force be with you!
