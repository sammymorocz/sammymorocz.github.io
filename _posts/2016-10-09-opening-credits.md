I’ve wanted to do this for a few months but didn’t think I would ever have the guts. Until now. Not sure what has changed but if I don’t do this now I know I never will.
Hello! Odds are you are here because you enjoy watching movies to some degree and in the dawn of Netflix, who doesn’t?

Thanks to my family and our endless collection of DVDs, I grew up in the world of film. And although knowing all kinds of facts about Jurassic Park (I,II, and III) didn’t
help me make conversation as a 10 year old, it certainly does now. Sort of. I feel like I can finally give some of my opinions on James Cameron as a director versus
screenwriter or about the reason Disney wins the academy award for animated picture every year (seriously, why?) and people feel somewhat interested in what I have to say.
The world of movies breaks down into so many categories: genre, different decades, actors, producers, story line, moral of the story…etc. that a blog about movies can suit
(or at least entertain) almost anyone. Hopefully that’s the case.

You can expect a bit of facts mixed with a lot of opinion but nevertheless, I’d love to hear your insight on the topics I decide to cover. Everyone’s a film critic now a
days after all.
