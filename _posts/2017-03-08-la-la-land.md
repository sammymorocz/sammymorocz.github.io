Hello there! Sorry about the brief absence. It took a movie like La La Land to pull me out my creative drought.

I am sure you have heard of La La Land by now, whether because you have seen it, heard about it from a fan, or because of the infamous mishap that occurred at the 2017
Academy Awards. Either way, itâ€™s probably a good time to talk about this film, which was directed by Damien Chazelle, the youngest director to have ever won an Oscar for
Best Director. This should be a big sign to why the movie is so popular among young people, especially young artists. (Hint: Because it was created by one). I wonâ€™t be
spoiling anything because I know a lot of people have not seen it yet but I also urge you to watch and come back to this blog post because I think a lot of great
conversation can be started around this film.

Like many others that I know, I watched La La Land with zero expectations other than a lot of my friends had really liked it. I had not watched the trailer or read
anything which is why I think it had such an impact on me. There are many aspects of the movie that are so incredible and pure as well some parts that I like to question
and talk about. I would also really like to hear your opinion on some of these so please feel free to leave a comment or share and tag me and Iâ€™d love to discuss it!

First, why I thought it was a great film. La La Land is a beautiful combination of past and present. It brings strong elements from a Hollywood that was reigned by black
and white musicals and classics, with strong personalities like Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds among many other talented actors and contrasted it with what is now modern
Los Angeles, a place of struggle and hope. It reflects the same melancholic theme that a lot of those movies used to portray against the happy innocence millennials are
characterized with today. The Dreamers. People that are brave enough to follow an artistic career. Actuallyâ€¦whether you are an artist or not, I think everyone can relate
to the idea of failure and disappointment, as well as the hope of success. I know I can.

Another aspect I really enjoyed is the music in the film. For those of you that are music enthusiasts, you will without a doubt enjoy all the references to the survival
of Jazz and the history of music. Something I loved was how Damien Chazelle was able to portray not only Jazz but also the city of LA both as their own living and
breathing characters in the film. They accompany the actors and change as the plot grows. But back to music, Iâ€¦am not a music fanatic. I enjoy music and musicals. I have
a Spotify and listen to music quite often but I really donâ€™t know a lot about the technicalities of music to say much about La La Land. But something I can comment on, or
further comment on, is something I saw on a video on YouTube. It was something a YouTuber named Dodie (channel: doddleoddle) said on a video she made about La La Land.
Dodie is a singer and artist and she loved La La Land. She said that she loved how the voices in La La Land were real voices. You can tell that these people are not
Broadway stars and that their voices are very simple and raw. When I first watched the film I thought this was a mistake, a great weakness. When Emma Stone sang for the
first time, I was at first quite disappointed with her weak vocal performance. But after watching Dodieâ€™s video, I realized that itâ€™s all part of why La La Land is great.
The story is about amateur artists trying to make it and struggling and being human beings filled with hopes and dreams and disappointments. And these are supposed to be
all real people withâ€¦real voices. The music is not supposed to take you out of these raw story and into this Broadway show. The music is supposed to further communicate
that realism. And from then on I have heard the soundtrack on repeat.

One thing I like to discuss (which is why I said the Donâ€™t on the title) is not really necessarily a bad thing, is just something to consider. I thought the plot of the
movie was an oversimplified love story. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I loved seeing Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone interact (and fall in love) for a third time (first two being
Crazy, Stupid Love, and Gangster Squad), this is something that was also done in the past Hollywood, where couples had on-screen chemistry and did several movies
together. But it was hard for me to believe that they were the characters. I think, and I am not completely sure about this, but I think it would have been more real with
actual struggling actors telling this story. Actors that have not quite made it yet. Actors that found La La Land to be their â€˜itâ€™. But like I said, Gosling and Stone did
an amazing job and the movie was not in any way hurt by them. I just wonder how it would have been with less known actors. I also wonder if the core plot was so simple so
that Chazelle could tell the general story of artists through it and not be overpowered by a more complex plot, which would make sense. I have seen this in the past. It
makes sense to use a very known story. Couple meets, falls in love, struggles, etc. And surrounding it, is a much more deeper story or another whole face of love we donâ€™t
often see. Itâ€™s the face of sacrifice, which is not always sacrifice something to be with the one you love, but it can also be sacrifice who you love for something else.
And I think La La Land does tell this deeper story very graciously. And although, for example, it actually ignited a lot of pain inside me and I know it touched so many
people, it is a story that should be told. Because love has so many faces. So I think for the people that, like me, think La La Land tells a very simple love story, we
should try to look at the darker face of love it shows. A much more human one.

I think since it was a movie created by artists for artists around Hollywood and also because it recreated a lot of the classic themes we have not seen since Hollywoodâ€™s
Golden Age, it makes sense that La La Land was nominated for so many things and won so many other things. But besides all that, if you ignore all the hype and wait until
everything goes quiet and the press moves on to another film, you will see that La La Land is still an amazing story and really enjoyable movie.

Let me know what you think! I would appreciate it so much if you shared this and Iâ€™ll see you soon with another post. Pinky promise ðŸ™‚
