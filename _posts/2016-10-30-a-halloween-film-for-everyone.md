Oh, Halloween. A time when suddenly everything is pumpkin themed and eating way too much candy is an achievement rather than something you want keep to yourself (guilty
as charged). Chilly air, colorful trees, pumpkin spiced – everything, and of course, some of the best types of movies of the year.

Whether you’re running out of time to pick the perfect movie for your Halloween-themed movie night or you really want to impress your friends (by giving them a spook),
here’s a list of films for every kind of person to enjoy with your MilkyWays and LaffyTaffies.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">For the not-so-scary halloween-er</span>: Today’s probably not your favorite holiday and frankly, masks are getting a little too realistic if you ask me. Especially those of
politicians. But you still deserve to have fun! While you enjoy some peace and quiet on Halloween night, I recommend to sit back, grab some chocolate and enjoy:

<h3>“Halloween Town” (1998)</h3>
Not only is this movie overflowing with super-cool Halloween references, but it has that good-vibes nostalgia only a Disney TV movie can provide. Although a bit of a
classic, the story line is timeless and the Piper siblings will constantly make you wish your witch Grandma came to visit to train you in the art of witchcraft.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Netflix Alternative:</span> “Practical Magic” (1998) – Less for kids but lots of magic! Did I mention Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are a pretty magical duo?

<span style="font-weight: bold;">For the lovebirds who might not quite finish the movie:</span> You’re trying to catch some time together while letting the trick-and-treaters come and go, you’re mostly
distracted, but you still want to indulge in the sinister mood of a horror film…

<h3>“Scream” (1996)</h3>
Looove the movie references inside this movie. I also really enjoy all of its sequels. This movie will let you have the right amount of suspense with the perfect amount
of thrill…Especially if you get a phone call in the middle of it.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Netflix Alternative:</span> “Scream 2” (1997). Not as good, but convenient.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">For the group of friends that are all about the screams:</span> You are looking for a good movie (hopefully that most of you have not yet watched) that will give half of the
group goosebumps they can shake off with laughter and make the other half scream sporadically during the movie.

<h3>“The Last Exorcism” (2010)</h3>
I am the biggest fan of scary movies, which doesn’t mean that I don’t get scared. It takes a couple of episodes of a sitcom or at times a Disney movie to go to sleep
after watching a real scary movie and I can honestly say that it took watching all of Tangled to close my eyes the night I decided to watch this movie. Scary. Big plot
twist. Watch it.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Netflix Alternative:</span> “Hush” (2016) Haven’t seen it yet but just watch the trailer…It’s on my high priority watch list. (How can a trailer be so scary?)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">For the all-time Halloween vibe:</span> It doesn’t really matter how scary the movie is as long as it really sets the mood for your Halloween night. You didn’t decorate the
house with pumpkins and fake spiderwebs for nothing. Whoever you are with, whatever else you’re doing, this is a movie that even in the background will really get to your
Halloween feels.

<h3>“The Nightmare Before Christmas” (1993)</h3>
Do you watch this in Halloween? Do you watch it in Christmas? Why not both? This is one of my all time favorite films. Period. It has one of the best soundtracks of any
Disney movie (dare I say) and it really is an example of Tim Burton’s unique work.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Netflix Alternative:</span> “Corpse Bride” (2005). Not neeeearly as good but can really be used for a similar purpose. Although, I’d definitely wouldn’t watch this on Christmas
too. That would just be weird.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Finally, for the one looking for a real classic:</span> You don’t mind rewatching a great movie and maybe your Halloween plans are to lay low. This movie will not disappoint.
It’s fill with thrill, really-fake blood, and a timeless character that will haunt all your dreams…and nightmares.

<h3>“A Nightmare on Elm Street” (1984)</h3>
My all-time favorite horror movie. From beginning to end, the plot is scary but makes sense. It has one of the scariest villains in movie history. And also a young, very
cute Johnny Depp. For an 80’s movie, it’s pretty quick and doesn’t drag the viewer along. Ultimate human vs. evil plot. Epic.

<img class="img-center" src="/images/4-nightmare-elm-street.gif"/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Netflix Alternative:</span> “Wes Craven’s New Nightmare” (1994). There’s no real substitute for the original but this one does a pretty good job.

Whether you liked one of my suggestions or you have one of your own, let me know in the comments!

Happy watching everyone! Have a spook-tacular Halloween and stay safe!
