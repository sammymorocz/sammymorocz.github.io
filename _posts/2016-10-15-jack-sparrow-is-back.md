By now, I’m sure everyone has seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tells (DMTNT) trailer. If you haven’t, here you go:

This trailer was full of things we already love about the world of Pirates of the Caribbean…Dark hues, mystery, wrecked ships, and of course, pirates. We see a couple of
new faces, including who everyone is assuming to be William and Elizabeth’s son. There’s a potential, creepy-looking villain and a drawing of the character that changed
cinema history, Jack Sparrow. The music sets the stage for what I hope is an adventurous thrill-filled film with pirate stories and legends as well as romance and comedy.

There is, however, one little aspect of the trailer that worries me. I’ve seen this happen to a lot of big franchise series and trilogies, and I like to call it a
“Disproportional Antagonist”. Let me explain. When a very successful movie decides to have a second and third, even fourth, movie, it is expected that with every movie,
the plot will increasingly become more interesting. At least until the final where it is hoped that all the plots tie back together. Still with me? Great!

For some reason, a lot of the times, screenwriters, directors, and producers (the whole gang you could say) don’t make the smartest decisions and they confuse a more
“interesting plot” with a bigger, more-explosive, end-of-the-world plot. And most of the times, this gets out of hand. A Disproportional Antagonist occurs when the
villain (or the villain’s plan) is so big and destructive and out of proportion that the hero is left doing pretty incredible (or unbelievable) things. As in, they’re
hard to believe, which can lead to big plot-holes. This makes the whole movie, no matter how fictional it’s meant to be, seem…unrealistic and frankly, boring.

Yes, now a days there are great computer effects to make explosions seem more realistic and yes, the “end-of-the-world” is a scary thought. But when the hero has 10 to 15
minutes to fix a problem that escalated from 0 to 100 in the last half of the film, especially knowing that this is the last film in a series, it just seems…not
interesting at all. Of course he or she is going to save the world. That’s not the point. I’ve seen this happen to many films and though I may get into more detail in
another post, a couple of examples are: The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Avengers, and Transformers…All amazing, box-office killers with endings that leave the viewers with
more to desire.

The Dark Knight Trilogy is one of my favorite examples. Batman Begins was a great first movie. The plot was small enough to allow the hero to grow and introduce the right
characters, but interesting enough to go full cycle, and leave the viewer satisfied. The Dark Knight did a fantastic job in increasing the thrill of the plot from the
first movie and rather than just having more explosions, it gave light to one of the most interesting villains in comic, and film, history. The Joker (Heath Ledger) was
not only more deadly, but also more interesting than Henri Ducard and the League of Shadows in the first movie. The transition between films was done with elegance and
within the realistic realm of a DC comic.

Then, we have The Dark Knight Rises. Although this movie was pretty good, with great Box-Office results and well-rounded characters, it left a bitter taste by the end.
Bane (Tom Hardy) was a pretty terrific villain, among all the others that appeared in the movie, but the plot was so large and out of proportion that it just really felt
like Batman shouldn’t have won. Maybe it was because of the nuclear bomb or because there were so many villains against him or because it really felt like some plot-holes
were never addressed. Either way, it was just…not exactly what I was expecting.

These movies, as I’m sure DMTNT will too, have great box-office results and even some awards for “visual effects” and “soundtrack”. What I hope is that the screenwriters
for DMTNT set the bar low for the first movie in the new series, rather than start right off from where the third or fourth movie left us, in a Disproportional Antagonist
way, just to try to impress the audience. On Stranger’s Tide and At World’s End both did not do a very good job of keeping a proportional plot for the hero. And since The
Black Pearl holds such a dear place in my heart, I’m hoping DMTNT will have a more interesting, unique plot that will make it memorable.
