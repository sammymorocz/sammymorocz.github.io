Hello fellow movie lovers! Today we are not talking about a movie. (Gasp). But don‚Äôt go away just yet!

Backtrack‚Ä¶As much as I love movies, I love watching a good series as well. However, after a very unfortunate semester of school, my time for tv-shows (or movies) has been
very limited. The semester has finally come to an end and I was able to catch up on watching some of the biggest shows out right now, mainly Stranger Things. If you‚Äôve
already seen it, I know I‚Äôm super late to the game but you‚Äôll appreciate my effort with the title of this post. If you haven‚Äôt, fear not! Here are 11 reasons why you
should. Enjoy!

<h3>#1 The show is set in the 80‚Äôs</h3>
From the wardrobe to the small town vibe, graphics and theme song, this show is a jewel dug out straight from the 80‚Äôs, a decade ruled by mix tapes, Michael Jackson, and
great films. The entire show is a shout out to what made the 1980‚Äôs a decade to remember, especially in entertainment. And to those of us who weren‚Äôt actually alive a few
decades ago, we still feel the nostalgia to movies like Terminator, Back to the Future, The Goonies, and many other iconic films.

<h3>#2 The Goonies meets Stephen King meets Steven Spielberg</h3>
I can‚Äôt even put into words what watching this series felt like. It makes me seriously fangirl. It was as if I had gone back in time to when I was a lot younger and my
older brothers and I watched The Goonies on our giant cube of a television. For those of you that haven‚Äôt watched The Goonies: First, give it a try, it‚Äôs fantastic.
Second, the plot follows a group of kids who find an old treasure map and go on an action packed adventure. Although the plots differ, Stranger Things did a fantastic job
of making younger kids the main characters of the show. It made us trust them, root for them, and bite our nails to see what would happen to them. The development of
their relationship and the purity of their friendship is comparable only to The Goonies‚Äô. Now, Stranger Things is definitely a lot darker in plot and it‚Äôs obvious that
the Duffer brothers were inspired by the thrilling mystery of a good Stephen King plot and a Steven Spielberg-y ET film style.

<h3>#3 Conspiracy Theory</h3>
This is a bit of a nerdy point. But I just love a good conspiracy theory. Not necessarily because I believe it‚Äôs true, but because I find it fascinating to see how we
blindly believe everything we‚Äôre told. There‚Äôs a line in the show (no spoilers) where one of the character says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the government. They want to help us.‚Äù Or something
along that line. And it was just so incredible to see that. How we are so focused in our own suburban lives that we never question anything twice‚Ä¶.Like I said, a bit of a
nerdy point. But it does make the show incredibly fascinating and kept me on my toes the entire time.

<h3>#4 Winona Ryder and other fantastic actors</h3>
Much like The Goonies, or Aliens, or any other 80‚Äôs classic, the cast of Stranger Things was really well selected. I especially enjoyed the fact that no one was too
familiar, which is one of my personal favorite things. This was the breakout series for pretty much the entire younger cast. And I think the only one I recognized
immediately by name and face was Winona, who to be fair did her job so well that it felt like a fresh start for her too. There‚Äôs something about unknown faces that makes
the story more real. Once you‚Äôve seen the same actor play a million different roles, unless that actor is exceptional, it‚Äôs easy to get characters mixed up which takes
you away from the current plot.

<h3>#5 It‚Äôs on Netflix!</h3>
Although I‚Äôm all for savoring a series, I also love a good binge watch. I must warn you though, Season 2 doesn‚Äôt come out until later next year. But for now, have at it.
Promise you won‚Äôt regret it.
Also, can we talk about all the amazing original shows and movies Netflix has been creating lately?

<h3>#6 The Plot</h3>
I‚Äôm going to be honest, some people might not necessarily love every bit of the Stranger Things plot. That‚Äôs only because it‚Äôs a horror/science fiction/thrilling mystery
and that‚Äôs just not something a lot of people like. However, it does have teen romance, a bit of humor, and action. The plot follows the story of a group of younger boys
who are determined to find their best friend, Will, who has gone missing. In their search, they find a girl with telekinetic abilities who might be able to help them.
Meanwhile, Will‚Äôs mom is also looking for him and claims she can hear him somehow.

That was probably a terrible synopsis but I really didn‚Äôt want to give much away. I went into Stranger Things not knowing anything and I think that is one of the reasons
I loved it so much.

<h3>#7 Fantastic Soundtrack</h3>
The show has a mix of 80‚Äôs classics with a gory original soundtrack. The theme song of the series is enough to get the hairs behind your neck standing.

<h3>#8 The Science Fiction</h3>
Like I said before, not everyone likes science fiction. I, for one, love it. If you seen movies like Alien, Super 8, ET‚Ä¶they all have very different plots, but share one
thing in common. Science Fiction is fictional stories that involve scientific or technological advances that might seem impossible today, space and time traveling, or
anything that could be explained by science but is just not feasible in our reality. Stranger Things has a lot of that and is effing great.

<h3>#9 The feels</h3>
Oh man. This show was a roller coaster of emotions. It had me gasping at the end of most episodes and gave my stomach a twist or two. It also worked so carefully on each
character development that it was able to pull my heart strings in all the right places. From the kids to the parents and everyone in between, it‚Äôs easy to see why this
show was such a major hit. The only relationship I was disappointed by (and no spoilers) was Nancy and Barbara. I felt like that was supposed to be a very strong
friendship in order for the viewer to feel a stronger connection to Barb, but it just wasn‚Äôt. At least for me.

Also, I love El with all my heart.

<h3>#10 Love Triangle</h3>
Yup. There‚Äôs a major love triangle between Nancy and her two boys: Steve and Jonathan. You kind of root for both which is very particular of a love triangle. (I like
Jonathan a bit better though.) Hopefully season 2 will clarify these relationships a little more since the show did leave us hanging.

<h3>#11 There‚Äôs more to come‚Ä¶</h3>
No spoilers but the ending was insane. We know they are working on season 2 and that at least all the child actors are coming back. This makes me so happy. It could have
been wrapped up pretty nicely to be a one shot kind of show, but at the very end you realize there are way too many loose ends that need to be addressed. Hopefully they
are in Season 2.

So that‚Äôs that. I hope you liked this post! Hopefully during winter break I‚Äôll be able to watch a lot more things so we can talk about them too üôÇ

Goodbye!
