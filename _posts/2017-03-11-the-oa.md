Hello, again! With so many great movies out, I know it’s kind of odd for me to be talking about a Netflix Original TV show. The problem is that I have been wanting to
write about this show for the longest time and haven’t gotten around to it. If you haven’t seen The OA, I highly recommend it, but, just so you know, it is unlike any
other show I have seen. I will also try to keep this post spoiler-free since part of what makes the show so addicting is not knowing what happens.

First, let’s talk about the story line. Have you seen such an original plot on a TV show, like, ever? I have talked about this with a few of my friends who have seen the
show and although, yes, the plot line can be exhausting because you are constantly in a state of “what does that mean?” or “what the heck is happening?”, it hooks you
pretty much from the very beginning. I remember watching the first 10 minutes of the show and saying “yeah, this is okay”, but fast-forwarding to the last 5 minutes of
the first episode and the show had my full attention. I loved the reoccurring theme of spirituality, which stays far away from any sort of religious reference, yet still
emphasize the human natural necessity to have faith in something. Although it feels like you’re watching something really weird sometimes, it is that same feeling that
makes you want to keep watching.

Now, for the characters. Brit Marling is not only the creator and executive producer of the show, but she also plays the main character, Prairie Johnson. The entire plot
surrounds Prairie’s life and Marling does a fantastic job of keeping you at the edge of your seat. However, even better than that, in my opinion, was the incredible
performance of the 5 people Prairie finds to help her. Within the cast, there are both familiar faces, like Phyllis Smith from The Office, and fresh new faces. All of
them do a fantastic job as a group of misfits in an average American town who are all broken somehow, all looking for something more. I personally love Ian Alexander’s
performance as  Buck. It was incredibly genuine and opened up the story to true diversity of characters.

Although there are several aspects of fantasy/science fiction, this TV show was more human and real than a lot of other things I have seen on TV. It explores the themes
of different sorts of love: paternal, sexual, unconditional…It shows the dangers of science against the human condition and the obsession humans have regarding the
afterlife, instead of focusing on our current lives on Earth. It shows faith through a different lense, which I loved, and it says that it’s not only important to have
faith in something bigger than yourself, but it’s also important to have faith in people. Ultimately, this show was a tale of good vs. evil. And as crazy as the plot is
and as weird as it gets, it has been a while since I have seen such an authentic story.

Something all of my friends said was that the ending was incredibly annoying because it didn’t answer any of their questions. And although, yeah, I can see why they would
want straightforward answers, I personally loved the open ended questions. Do we believe the OA or do we cast her away as another crazy person looking for attention?
Regardless of whether she is crazy or everything she said was true, she managed to bring the most different people together and made them feel just a little less
lonely…does that not count? Are we more connected to an afterlife than we think? Or should we just forget about what happens after we die and just try to make heaven out
of our lives now?

The ending gave the viewer a freedom that I usually only see in books: the freedom of interpretation. It’s up to you to decide what happened to her. I like to believe
Prairie was able to accomplish what she wanted, and, along the way, save those who helped her: Betty, Steve, Jesse, French, and Buck, from their brokenness.

Ahhhhh….I could just talk about this show forever. But I’ll stop here. Let me know what you think! Did you love it or hate it? It could actually go either way with this
show to be honest.

Thanks for reading!
